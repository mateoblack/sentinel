# Roadmap: Sentinel

## Overview

Sentinel adds intent-aware access control to aws-vault, evaluating policy rules before issuing AWS credentials. The journey starts with CLI foundation and aws-vault integration, moves through policy schema design and SSM-based loading, implements the core decision engine, then exposes this through credential_process and exec commands with full logging and profile compatibility.
