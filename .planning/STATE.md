# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-01-16)

**Core value:** Credentials are issued only when policy explicitly allows it — no credentials, no access, no exceptions.
**Current focus:** v1.5 Enforcement & Assurance — Prove Sentinel is actually enforced

## Current Position

Phase: 43 of 49 (Enforcement Types)
Plan: Not started
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-01-16 — Milestone v1.5 created

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Key decisions from v1.0, v1.1, and v1.2 logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.

**v1.3 Break-Glass decisions (Phase 33-34):**
- Rate limit check order: cooldown -> user quota -> profile quota -> escalation flag
- Escalation threshold does not block, only flags for notification
- RetryAfter only populated for cooldown blocks (quota blocks have no simple retry time)
- Empty AllowedReasonCodes = all reason codes allowed (wildcard)
- Empty Profiles = rule applies to all profiles (wildcard)
- MaxDuration 0 = no cap (use system default)

**v1.4 Bootstrap Schema decisions (Phase 35):**
- ResourceState includes 'exists' and 'skip' as separate states for clarity
- PlanSummary.ToSkip counts both skip and exists states
- SSM path validation uses regex for alphanumeric, /, -, _ characters
- Profile name validation matches AWS conventions (alphanumeric, -, _)

**v1.4 Bootstrap Planner decisions (Phase 36):**
- ssmAPI interface follows notification/sns.go pattern for testability
- Planner validates config before making any SSM calls
- IAM policy documents always show StateCreate (generated, not actual IAM resources)
- Format symbols: + (create), ~ (update), = (exists), - (skip)

**v1.4 SSM Parameter Creation decisions (Phase 37):**
- Use String type for parameters (not SecureString) since policy YAML is not sensitive
- Overwrite=false for create to detect race conditions
- Continue processing on individual failures (don't abort entire apply)
- Skip IAM policy resources (not SSM) and non-actionable states

**v1.4 Status Command decisions (Phase 41):**
- Separate ssmStatusAPI interface (GetParametersByPath) from planner's ssmAPI (GetParameter)
- Non-recursive query (Recursive=false) to get direct children only
- Human output includes profile name padding for alignment

### Deferred Issues

None — clean implementation across all milestones.

### Blockers/Concerns Carried Forward

None — clean start for v1.4.
