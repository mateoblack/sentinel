<objective>
Update CHANGELOG.md with all shipped v1.13-v1.18 releases

Purpose: Close documentation gap - CHANGELOG currently shows v1.13 and v1.14 as "Unreleased" and is missing v1.15-v1.18 entirely.
Output: CHANGELOG.md with all 6 versions marked as released with accurate ship dates.

  <name>Task 1: Mark v1.13 and v1.14 as released</name>
  <files>docs/CHANGELOG.md</files>
  <action>
Update the version headers:
1. Change `## [Unreleased - v1.14]` to `## [1.14.0] - 2026-01-25`
2. Change `## [1.13.0] - Unreleased` to `## [1.13.0] - 2026-01-24`

Do NOT modify any content below those headers - just update the version/date lines.

  <name>Task 2: Add v1.15-v1.18 sections</name>
  <files>docs/CHANGELOG.md</files>
  <action>
Add new version sections between the current `## [1.14.0]` section and `## [1.13.0]` section. Insert them in reverse chronological order (newest first).

**v1.18 section** (insert after v1.14, before v1.17):
```
## [1.18.0] - 2026-01-26

### Added

- KMS-based policy signing with RSASSA_PSS_SHA_256 algorithm (`sentinel policy sign`)
- VerifyingLoader for signature-validated policy loading with fail-closed security
- `sentinel policy verify` command for local signature validation
- `--sign` flag for `sentinel policy push` to upload policy with signature
- Lambda TVM signature verification integration (SSM → Verifying → Cached pipeline)
- Security regression tests for policy tampering and cache poisoning prevention
```

**v1.17 section** (insert after v1.18, before v1.16):
```
## [1.17.0] - 2026-01-26

### Added

- Policy schema Version type with `IsValid()` and `IsCurrent()` validation methods
- `MarshalPolicy` for YAML serialization and round-trip policy editing
- `sentinel policy pull <profile>` fetches policy from SSM to stdout or file
- `sentinel policy push <profile> <file>` validates and uploads to SSM with confirmation
- `sentinel policy diff <profile> <file>` shows unified diff with color output
- `sentinel policy validate <file>` validates locally without AWS credentials
```

**v1.16 section** (insert after v1.17, before v1.15):
```
## [1.16.0] - 2026-01-26

### Added

- Timing-safe bearer token comparison via `crypto/subtle.ConstantTimeCompare`
- AWS Secrets Manager integration for MDM API token with 1-hour client-side caching
- CI/CD security scanning with govulncheck, gosec, and Trivy in GitHub Actions
- DynamoDB KMS encryption by default for all Sentinel tables
- API rate limiting with sliding window algorithm (100 req/min) for Lambda TVM
- Error sanitization across all credential endpoints (log details, return generic messages)
- Security integration tests validating hardening patterns
```

**v1.15 section** (insert after v1.16, before v1.14):
```
## [1.15.0] - 2026-01-25

### Added

- Device posture schema with DeviceID (64-char hex) and PostureStatus types
- MDM Provider interface with Jamf Pro implementation for server-side verification
- Lambda TVM queries MDM on credential requests (fail-open default, fail-closed optional)
- Policy device conditions: `require_mdm`, `require_encryption`, `require_mdm_compliant`
- Session device binding with DeviceID field and ListByDeviceID query
- Device audit commands (`sentinel device-sessions`, `sentinel devices`) with anomaly detection
```

Final order in CHANGELOG should be:
1. [1.18.0] - 2026-01-26
2. [1.17.0] - 2026-01-26
