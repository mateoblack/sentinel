<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Update v1.13 and v1.14 release status</name>
  <files>docs/CHANGELOG.md</files>
  <action>
Update the existing v1.13 and v1.14 entries:

1. Change `[Unreleased - v1.14]` to `[1.14.0] - 2026-01-25`
2. Change `[1.13.0] - Unreleased` to `[1.13.0] - 2026-01-24`
3. Ensure v1.14 appears BEFORE v1.13 (newer versions first)

The content for these versions already exists in the CHANGELOG - just fix the headers.
