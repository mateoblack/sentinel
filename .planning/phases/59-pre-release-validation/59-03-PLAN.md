Execute final pre-release checklist:

1. **Build verification:**
   ```bash
   go build ./...
   go build -o sentinel ./cmd/sentinel
   ./sentinel --version 2>/dev/null || ./sentinel --help | head -1
   rm ./sentinel
   ```

2. **Test verification:**
   ```bash
   go test ./... -race -count=1
   ```

3. **Lint verification (if available):**
   ```bash
   go vet ./...
   ```

4. **Module verification:**
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   go mod verify
   ```

5. **Security check:**
   - Verify no secrets in codebase:
     ```bash
     grep -r "AKIA" --include="*.go" . | grep -v "_test.go" | grep -v "example" || echo "No AWS keys found"
     grep -r "password\s*=" --include="*.go" . | grep -v "_test.go" | grep -v "Password" || echo "No hardcoded passwords"
     ```

6. Document checklist results:
   ```
