# v2.1 TVM Only

**Milestone Goal:** Remove classic mode entirely. Client-side device posture is fakeable. TVM/Lambda mode is server-verified. We don't ship fakeable security.

## Philosophy

```
Local mode: fakeable
Lambda mode: verified

Someone says: "I don't want to deploy Lambda..."
We say: "And hackers don't want to be blocked."
```

## Phases

### Phase 156: Remove Classic Mode
**Goal**: Eliminate all client-side-only credential paths
**Depends on**: Phase 155 (v2.0 complete)
**Requirements**: TVM-01
**Success Criteria** (what must be TRUE):
  1. Classic mode code paths removed from CLI
  2. `exec` and `credentials` commands require TVM endpoint
  3. Documentation updated to reflect TVM-only operation
  4. Migration guide for users moving from classic to TVM mode
  5. Clear error message when TVM endpoint not configured

Plans:
- [ ] 156-01: TBD during planning
