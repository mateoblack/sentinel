# Milestone v1.10.1: SSO Credential Fixes

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-19
**Phases:** 78.1
**Total Plans:** 2

## Overview

Add test coverage for SSO credential loading patterns established in v1.9. Fixes were already in place from v1.9; this milestone adds test verification for bootstrap and whoami commands' SSO profile support.

## Phases

### Phase 78.1: SSO Credential Fixes (INSERTED)

**Goal**: Add test coverage for SSO credential loading (fixes already in place from v1.9)
**Depends on**: Phase 78
**Research**: Unlikely (same pattern as v1.9 Phase 76)
**Plans**: 2

Plans:
- [x] 78.1-01: Add bootstrap command SSO profile test coverage — completed 2026-01-19
- [x] 78.1-02: Add whoami command SSO profile test coverage — completed 2026-01-19

**Details:**

Phase 78.1 was inserted as an urgent patch between Phase 78 (Server Infrastructure) and Phase 79 (Server Policy Integration) to add test coverage for the SSO credential loading patterns established in v1.9.

**Plan 78.1-01: Bootstrap SSO Profile Test Coverage**
- Added TestBootstrapCommand_UsesAWSProfileForCredentials with three sub-tests
- Verifies AWSProfile field acceptance for SSO profile names
- Verifies vault.LoadConfig recognizes SSO settings (SSOStartURL, SSORegion, SSOAccountID, SSORoleName)
- Verifies AWSProfile (credential source) and Profiles (bootstrap targets) are independent fields

**Plan 78.1-02: Whoami SSO Profile Test Coverage**
- Added TestWhoamiCommand_UsesProfileForAWSConfig with three sub-tests
- Verifies Profile field acceptance for SSO credential loading pattern
- Verifies SSO profile configuration recognition via vault.LoadConfig
- Follows patterns from credentials_test.go and sentinel_exec_test.go

## Milestone Summary

**Decimal Phases:**
- Phase 78.1: SSO Credential Fixes (inserted after Phase 78 for urgent test coverage)

**Key Decisions:**
- Combined Task 1 and Task 2 in both plans into single test functions with three sub-tests each
- Bootstrap tests verify AWSProfile/Profiles field independence (bootstrap has both target and source profiles)
- Whoami tests use ValidateProfile for temp config verification

**Issues Resolved:**
- None (test coverage addition, not bug fixes)

**Issues Deferred:**
- None

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None
